# Neural Kinetic Sculpture App 🎨🧠✨

Welcome to the Neural Kinetic Sculpture app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

A mobile application built in **React Native (Expo)** to control and visualize settings for the **Neural Kinetic Sculpture**—an interactive LED installation enhanced by EEG brainwave signals. This app allows users to map EEG-derived data (like alpha wave amplitudes) to dynamic behaviors of the sculpture such as LED brightness and movement speed. It also provides real-time-like playback of pre-recorded EEG signals and communicates with the sculpture via WIFI.

---

## 📱 Features

- **User Authentication** (via Supabase)
- **Configurable Settings**: Map EEG frequency bands (alpha, beta, delta, etc.) to:
  - LED brightness levels
  - Panel motion speeds
  - Sound triggers
- **Archive of EEG Recordings**:
  - Store & display EEG waveform CSVs
  - Playback with timestamp simulation
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Send configuration data wirelessly to the sculpture's microcontroller.
- **Clean UI** using **Tailwind (NativeWind)** for styling.

## ⚙️ Quick Setup Tips

### Get started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:

- [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a sandbox for trying out app development

Start developing by editing files inside the **app/** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

---

## 🔀 Resetting Project (Optional)

When you're ready to start fresh:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves starter code to the **app-example/** folder and creates a blank **app/** directory for development.
